# CLAUDE.md

This file contains important information for Claude when working with this codebase.

## Writing code

- CRITICAL: Never commit code yourself. Only Dev commits code.
- We prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
- Make the smallest reasonable changes to get to the desired outcome. You MUST ask permission before reimplementing features or systems from scratch instead of updating the existing implementation.
- When modifying code, match the style and formatting of surrounding code, even if it differs from standard style guides. Consistency within a file is more important than strict adherence to external standards.
- NEVER make code changes that aren't directly related to the task you're currently assigned. If you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, bring it up as a separate suggestion at the end of your response instead of fixing it immediately.
- NEVER remove code comments unless you can prove that they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and should be preserved even if they seem redundant or unnecessary to you.
- When writing comments, avoid referring to temporal context about refactors or recent changes. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is, not how it evolved or was recently changed.
- NEVER implement a mock mode for testing or for any purpose. We always use real data and real APIs, never mock implementations.
- When you are trying to fix a bug or compilation error or any other issue, YOU MUST NEVER throw away the old implementation and rewrite without explicit permission from the user. If you are going to do this, YOU MUST STOP and get explicit permission from the user.
- NEVER name things as 'improved' or 'new' or 'enhanced', etc. Code naming should be evergreen. What is new today will be "old" someday.
- Always add imports to the top of the file unless you have a good reason not to.
- If a CHANGELOG.md exists, update CHANGELOG.md as your final step.

## Getting help

- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you're having trouble with something, it's ok to stop and ask for help. Especially if it's something your human might be better at.

## Testing

- Tests MUST cover the functionality being implemented.
- NEVER ignore the output of the system or the tests. Logs and messages often contain CRITICAL information.
- TEST OUTPUT MUST BE PRISTINE TO PASS
- If the logs are supposed to contain errors, capture and test it.
- When you update a test to pass, remove any comment that mentions it failing.
- Use Pytest
- Use the fixtures in the app/tests/conftest.py if you can.
- Use function-based tests and not classes.

### We practice TDD. That means:

- Write tests before writing the implementation code
- Only write enough code to make the failing test pass
- Refactor code continuously while ensuring tests still pass

#### TDD Implementation Process

- Write a failing test that defines a desired function or improvement
- Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
- Write minimal code to make the test pass
- Run the test to confirm success
- Refactor code to improve design while keeping tests green
- Repeat the cycle for each new feature or bugfix

## Project Overview

Landale is a personal streaming overlay system designed for a single user on a local Tailscale network. It provides real-time, animated overlays for OBS streaming, including timer displays, Pok√©mon game trackers, and customizable visual elements. It is an event-driven monorepo with real-time WebSocket communication. The system coordinates between OBS, audio processing, AI services, and a web-based control dashboard to create dynamic stream content that responds to game events, audio cues, and manual controls.
